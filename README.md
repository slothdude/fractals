Trying it yourself
==========

```
git clone (project url)
start ./fractals/first-try/index.html
```
(or open index.html another way)

Overview
==========

A fractal is a shape that is the same when you zoom in on a specific part. In the
below example from
![diamond-with-graphics.js](./first-try/diamond-with-graphics.js),
notice how the 2 sides are identical to the whole:

*Note*: It's not animated, you control it with the mousewheel.

Getting Around
==============

To switch which fractal you are rendering, change the code in
![index.html](./first-try/index.html).
![sketch.js](./first-try/sketch.js) was my first try and is very slow, but you
can control the color with the slider on the left and the fractal depth with the
slider on the right.
